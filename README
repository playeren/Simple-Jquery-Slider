Yeah. Title says it all really. Nothing fancy. At all. No event hooks. Nothing. 

The script loads an array of images async after doc.ready and shows them one-by-one 
with a nice fadeIn effect. That's it. 

Inline comments should explain all the details. 

Depends on Jquery 1.7.1 (not really - works fine on older versions too)
